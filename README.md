Jesse Charbneau's code stash for GeekTool functional scripts


Note - These scripts are developed by me, for me.  If you choose to use them, I am ok with that, and don't give a rats @$$ regarding credit - but...

And here's the catch - No warranty, No replies to bitching/whining (you don't like something, feel free to *not* use it), No support, *YOU* are on your own with these scripts
