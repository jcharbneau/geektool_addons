Jesse Charbneau's code stash for GeekTool functional scripts


Note - These scripts are developed by me, for me.  If you choose to use them, I am ok with that, and don't give a rats @$$ regarding credit - but...

No warranty
No replies to bitching
No support
*YOU* are on your own with these scripts
